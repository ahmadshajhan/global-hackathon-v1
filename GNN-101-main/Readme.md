## 🧩 Abstract

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various domains.  
However, their **complex structures** and **inner workings** can be challenging for non-AI experts to grasp.

To bridge this gap, we present **GNN101**, an **educational visualization tool** for interactive learning of GNNs.

**GNN101** seamlessly integrates:
- 🎓 Mathematical formulas  
- 🧩 Visual animations  
- 🔄 Multi-layer abstractions  
- 🧠 Dual visualization modes:
  - **Node-Link View:** intuitive graph exploration  
  - **Matrix View:** detailed feature transformations  

By combining **style, animation, and interactivity**, **GNN101** demystifies how GNNs learn — visually and intuitively — while running entirely in your **web browser** with **no installations required**.
